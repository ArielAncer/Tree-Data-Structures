# Tree-Data-Structures
This repository is a compilation of various tree data structures and the methods needed to manipulate them.

Included are the following trees:
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree

Each includes the various methods that are used to manipulate the tree data structure i.e 
- Auto-Balancing 
- BST Sort
- InOrder, PreOrder and PostOrder Traversal
- Right and Left Rotations

Each tree class will have a test included with it. If there are inconsistencies with the algorithms, 
I apologize and would love your remarks.
